Junior Data analyst
-------------------

Hello! I'm Nkem, an enthusiastic professional new to the field of Data Analysis. With a background in cybersecurity from Wilmington University, I bring a unique perspective to data analysis, blending technical proficiency with a strong understanding of data security. I pursued a bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity at Wilmington University, where I gained a solid foundation in data protection, network security, and ethical hacking. This foundation supports my data analysis work, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. Although new to the field, I have quickly gained hands-on experience with tools like Python, SQL, and Power BI. I've developed data visualization dashboards, performed data migration and cleansing, and generated reports to drive business intelligence. My work in statistical analysis has helped interpret data trends and forecast outcomes. I hold a Certified Server Pro 2016: Install and Storage certification and made the Academic Dean's List, receiving a Certification of Honor for my academic achievements. These accolades highlight my commitment to continuous learning and excellence. I'm excited to join a dynamic team where I can further develop my skills and contribute to impactful data projects.
